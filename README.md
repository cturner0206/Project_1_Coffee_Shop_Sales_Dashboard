The goal of this project was to develop a comprehensive Q1-Q2 sales dashboard for a coffee shop solely using Microsoft Excel. This dashboard aims to provide insights into sales performance, customer trends, and product popularity, enabling informed decision-making for business strategies.

# Data Source

The sales data used in this project is the "CoffeeShopSales.xlsx" file. 

# Data Preparation/Cleaning

The initial data preparation/cleaning phase involved:
- Understanding the different columns used in the dataset.
- Inspecting the columns to see if there needed to be any changes to the data.
- Making any necessary changes to clean the data using Power Query. Cleansing steps performed include:
  - Assigning column headers and renaming  
  - Changing data types
  - Removing duplicates + fixing spelling errors in some of the products
  - Breaking up the product detail column to have product size as a separate column
