# Project Overview

The goal of this project was to develop a comprehensive Q1-Q2 sales dashboard for a coffee shop solely using Microsoft Excel. This dashboard aims to provide insights into sales performance, customer trends, and product popularity, enabling informed decision-making for business strategies.

# Data Source

The sales data used in this project is the "CoffeeShopSales.xlsx" file. 

# Data Preparation/Cleaning

The initial data preparation/cleaning phase involved:
- Understanding the different columns used in the dataset.
- Inspecting the columns to see if there needed to be any changes to the data.
- Making any necessary changes to clean the data using Power Query. Cleansing steps performed include:
  - Assigning column headers and renaming  
  - Changing data types
  - Removing duplicates + fixing spelling errors in some of the products
  - Breaking up the product detail column to have product size as a separate column
    
# Building the Dashboard

To create the dashboard visuals, pivot tables played a crucial role in organizing and segmenting the sales data. Each visual on the dashboard uses a different pivot table to filter the data. 

The dashboard includes slicers linked to the pivot tables, which allows for interactivity and data exploration for end users. Users can click on specific product categories or time periods to filter the visuals dynamically, allowing for tailored insights and more in-depth analysis.
